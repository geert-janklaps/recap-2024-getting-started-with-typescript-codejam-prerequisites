# Prerequisites

There are hardware, software and service prerequisites for participating in this workshop. The exercises will be shown executing in the [SAP Business Application Studio](https://community.sap.com/topics/business-application-studio) as the development tool. However you can also execute them [locally on your own tooling such as Microsoft VSCode](#prerequisites-for-performing-the-exercises-locally).

There is also an option that allows you to use VS Code locally but remotely connect it to your Business Application Studio dev space. This avoids the need to install all the prerequisites to local development.
